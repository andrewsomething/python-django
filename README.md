## What is Django?

Django is a high-level web application framework that loosely follows
the model-view-controller design pattern.  Python's equivalent to Ruby
on Rails, Django lets you build complex data-driven websites quickly
and easily - Django focuses on automating as much as possible and
adhering to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.  Django
additionally emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components;
many generic third-party "applications" are available to enhance
projects or to simply to reduce development time even further.

Notable features include: 

- An object-relational mapper (ORM)
- Automatic admin interface
- Elegant URL dispatcher
- Form serialization and validation system
- Templating system
- Lightweight, standalone web server for development and testing
- Internationalization support
- Testing framework and client

## The charm


This charm will install Django. It can also install your Django
project and his dependencies from either a template or from a
version control system.

It can also link your project to a database and sync the schemas.
This charm also come with a Fabric fabfile to interact with the
deployement in a cloud aware manner.


## Quick start

Simply::
    
    juju bootstrap
    juju deploy python-django

    juju deploy postgresql
    juju add-relation python-django postgresql:db

    juju deploy gunicorn
    juju add-relation python-django gunicorn
    juju expose python-django

In a couple of minute, your new (vanilla) Django site should be ready at
the public address of gunicorn. You can find it in the output of the
`juju status` command.  

This is roughtly equivalent to the [Creating a project](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/#creating-a-project) step in Django's
tutorial.

### Example: Deploying using site a template

1. Setup your Django specific parameters in mydjangosite.yaml like this one::

        mydjangosite:
            project_template_url: https://github.com/xenith/django-base-template/zipball/master
            project_template_extension: py,md,rst

Note: If your using juju-core you must remove the first line
of the file and the indentation for the rest of the file.

1. Deployment with `Gunicorn`::

        juju bootstrap
        juju deploy --config mydjangosite.yaml mydjangosite

        juju deploy postgresql
        juju add-relation mydjangosite postgresql:db

        juju deploy gunicorn
        juju add-relation mydjangosite gunicorn
        juju expose mydjangosite


### Example: Deploying using code repository

1. Setup your Django specific parameters in mydjangosite.yaml like this one::

        mydjangosite:
            vcs: bzr        
            repos_url: lp:~patrick-hetu/my_site

Note: 

If your using juju-core you must remove the first line
of the file and the indentation for the rest of the file.

1. Deployment with `Gunicorn`::

        juju bootstrap
        juju deploy --config mydjangosite.yaml python-django

        juju deploy postgresql
        juju add-relation python-django postgresql:db

        juju deploy gunicorn
        juju add-relation python-django gunicorn
        juju expose python-django

Note: If your using juju-core you must add --upload-tools to the
`juju bootstrap` command.

1. Accessing your new Django site should be ready at the public address of
   Gunicorn. To find it look for it in the output of the `juju status` command.  

## Project layout and code injection

Taking the previous example, your web site should be on the Django node at:

    /srv/python-django/

As you can see there the charm have inject some code at the end of your settings.py
file (or created it if it was not there) to be able to import what's in the
`juju_settings/` directory.

It's recommended to make your vcs to ignore database and secret files or
any files that have information that you don't want to be publish.

## Upgrade the charm

This charm allow you to upgrade your deployment using the Juju's
`upgrade-charm` command. This command will:

- upgrade Django
- upgrade additionnal pip packages
- upgrade additionnal Debian packages
- upgrade using requirements files in your project

## Management with Fabric

[Fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org) is a Python (2.5 or higher) library and command-line tool for
streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems
administration tasks.

It provides a basic suite of operations for executing
local or remote shell commands (normally or via sudo) and uploading/downloading
files, as well as auxiliary functionality such as prompting the running user
for input, or aborting execution.

This charm includes a Fabric script that use Juju's information to perform various
tasks.

For a list of tasks type this command after bootstraping your Juju environment::

    fab -l

For example, with a python-django service deployed you can run commands on all its units::

    fab -R python-django pull
    [10.0.0.2] Executing task 'pull'
    [10.0.0.2] run: bzr pull lp:~my_name/django_code/my_site
    ...
    [10.0.0.2] run: invoke-rc.d gunicorn restart
    ...

Or you can also run commands on a single unit::

    fab -R python-django/0 manage:createsuperuser
    ...
    [10.0.0.2] out: Username (leave blank to use 'ubuntu'):


Limitation:

- You can only execute task for one role at the time.
  But it can be a service or unit.

If you want to extend the fabfile check out [fabtools](http://fabtools.readthedocs.org/
).

## Security

Note that if your using a `requirement.txt` file the packages will
be downloaded with `pip` and it doesn't do any cryptographic
verification of its downloads.

## Writing application charm

To create an application subordinate charm that can be related to this charm you need
at least to define an interface named `directory-path` in your `metadate.yaml` file
like this::

  [...]
  requires:
    python-django:
       interface: directory-path
       scope: container
       optional: true

When you will add a relation between your charm and the python-django charm
the hook you will be able to get those relation variables:

- `settings_dir_path`
- `urls_dir_path`
- `django_admin_cmd`
- `install_root`

now your charm will be informed about where it need to add new settings
and urls files and how to run additionnal Django commands. 
The Django charm reload Gunicorn after the relation to catch the changes.
